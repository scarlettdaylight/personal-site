  Despite it's only a short period of time, it was a great pleasure to work with HK01 colleagues to revamp HK01 main site using ReactJS.
  
  We develop in a more organized and structured way as we run scrum in here.
  
  I have learnt a lot from my colleagues as I was not very skillful at ReactJS at that time. They are all very friendly and willing to teach me.
