  In Prizm I was responsible for developing various kinds of campaigns for our clients. 
  
  I am very grateful that I could have the chance to try different kinds of technologies as we have the freedom to do so.
  
  After around one year I was promoted to Analyst Programmer and was assigned to payment team and develop internal CRM with my colleagues.
